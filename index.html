    <h1>The Fox Guide to GTNH</h1>
    <p>The intent of this guide is to provide detailed information on how to progress through Gregtech New Horizons. Although the
        questbook is very helpful, it fails to provide players with any sense of direction at many stages of the game. This guide
        is organized chronologically and covers everything from the Stone Age to the Star Gate.</p>
    <p>Any suggestions or comments are welcome!</p>

    <h2>Tier 0: Stone</h2>
    Like many great modpacks, your journey begins with punching a tree for some wood.
